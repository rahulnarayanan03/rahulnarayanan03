## Hi there 👋

I’m Rahul, a mechatronic engineering student at UTS, graduating in late 2026. I enjoy building projects that combine mechanical, electrical, and software components, especially ones with real-world impact.

### 🔭 Currently working on
- Developing a self-driving “Follow-Me” esky with LiDAR, UWB tags, and computer vision for robust tracking and autonomous movement.
- Capstone projects integrating mechanical design, electronics, and AI-powered control systems.

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Advanced robotics and automation techniques
- State-of-the-art AI and computer vision (YOLOv8, OpenCV, prompt engineering)
- Embedded systems using STM-32 and FPGA

### 💻 Skills
- **Programming:** C++, Python, Arduino, MATLAB  
- **AI & Computer Vision:** YOLOv8, OpenCV, prompt engineering, (consider adding TensorFlow/PyTorch if you want)  
- **Electronics & Embedded Systems:** STM-32, Raspberry Pi, FPGA  
- **Mechanical & Fabrication:** CAD, welding, circuit assembly, drive systems  
- **Other:** Path planning, localisation, LiDAR integration, UWB tracking

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on
- Robotics projects
- Autonomous vehicles or drones (RC or full-scale)
- AI + embedded systems projects

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I optimise daily life for efficiency and sustainability
- Favourite cars: BMW M5 and Mazda CX-5 diesel
- I plan to live a fully solar-powered lifestyle
- Chess, Pokémon Showdown, Clash Royale, and Halo keep my competitive side sharp
