## Hi there 👋

I’m Rahul, a mechatronic engineering student at UTS, graduating in November 2026. I enjoy building projects that combine mechanical, electrical, and software components, especially ones with real-world impact.

### 🔭 Currently working on -
- Developing my capstone project: an Autonomous Cooling Cart that integrates mechanical design, electronics, LiDAR, UWB tracking, and AI-powered computer vision for autonomous navigation.

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Advanced robotics and automation techniques
- State-of-the-art AI and computer vision (YOLOv8, OpenCV, prompt engineering)

### 💻 Skills
- **Programming:** C++, Python, MATLAB  
- **AI & Computer Vision:** YOLOv8, OpenCV, Prompt Engineering  
- **Embedded & Mechatronic Systems:** Arduino, STM-32, Raspberry Pi, LiDAR integration, UWB tracking, Path Planning, Localisation, Drive Systems 
- **Mechanical & Fabrication:** Machining, Welding, Drilling, Riveting, Machine Assembly
- **Electrical:** Circuit Analysis, Multimeters and Oscilloscopes, Wiring, Soldering, PCB Assembly  

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on
- Robotic projects
- Autonomous vehicles or drones (RC or full-scale)
- AI + embedded systems projects

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I optimise daily life for efficiency and sustainability
- Love ICE Cars
- I plan to live a fully solar-powered lifestyle
- Chess, Pokémon, Clash Royale, and Halo keep my competitive side sharp
